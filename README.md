"# JsonApi" 

Json api is a data based api made because I was fed up with my exactly 3 hours of working with SQL. So I wanted to do better, and started making this, it's to the point now to test, please download this and help me test this

Very poor documentation for now: (%whatever% is a variable, you'll need to replace these)
/gettoken       -> to get a token and key
/upload?token=%token%&key=%key%&filename=%filename%       -> to upload a file, variables are your token and key, and a filename
/load?token=%token%&key=%key%&filename=%filename%       -> to load a file, variables are your token and key, and a filename
