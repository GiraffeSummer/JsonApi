"# JsonApi" 

Json api is a data based api made because I was fed up with my exactly 3 hours of working with SQL. So I wanted to do better, and started making this, it's to the point now to test, please download this and help me test this

Very poor documentation for now: (%whatever% is a variable, you'll need to replace these)<br /><br />
**/gettoken**<br />
-> to get a token and key<br /><br />
**/upload?token=%token%&key=%key%&filename=%filename%**       <br />
-> to upload a file, variables are your token and key, and a filename <br /> <br />
**/load?token=%token%&key=%key%&filename=%filename%**  <br />
-> to load a file, variables are your token and key, and a filename   <br />
